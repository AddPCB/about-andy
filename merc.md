# Mercedes_Benz of Cheshire oaks

At Mercedes there is a very structured career path and qualifications that I followed. I went from starting as a service advisor and looking after customers to completing my management qualifications and becoming the Senior Advisor. This ment instead of being part of the team I now had to manage them, this gave a whole new perspective upon my career. Having five staff my team I negotiated and managed the performance and drove the team towards our targets. Our KPI were base upon customer satisfaction and conversion of identified work.
After being in the role for two years a role came up to become workshop manager. Being sucessfull in my application my team grew from five to ninteen staff.
