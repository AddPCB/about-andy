# The Beach

The Beach was one of my first jobs upon leaving school. It is a very popular nightclub in Birkenhead. Within the nightclub I worked behind the bar but also managed the stock levels for the alcohol. This tought me to stay cool under presure, needing good personable skills and fast math.
