# Honda Two Mills

I started at Two Mills Honda stepping into my career in the motortrade which spanned over two decades.
Working as a service advisor I had to have excellent customer/ problem solving skills. Honda had strict KPI's which had to be met. I would often be the first person the customer would see as they stepped into the dealership.
